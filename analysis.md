# League of Legends Dashboard Analysis

## Introduction

As a passionate gamer and data analyst, I have spent nearly a decade playing League of Legends. This extensive experience has given me a deep understanding of the game's mechanics, strategies, and nuances. Combining my love for gaming with my analytical expertise, I have developed a comprehensive League of Legends dashboard. 

The purpose of this dashboard is to provide a detailed analysis of parameters, metrics, tools, and analytical approaches used in the development of this League of Legends dashboard, offering valuable insights that can help players improve their gameplay. By including this project in my portfolio, I aim to demonstrate my proficiency in data analysis, visualization, and the practical application of analytical skills in a gaming-world context.

-The dashboard can make an analysis between 3-100 matches in the specific modes of Ranked or normal.
